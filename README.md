# led-cube-data
File specification used in my LED cube projects.
Currently, this package only includes parsers, serializers, assemblers for Python.

The file specification is defined in a ksy file,
so parsers for other languages can be made easily via the [Kaitai Struct compiler](https://kaitai.io/).
